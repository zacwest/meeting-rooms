# Meeting Rooms

This is a calendar app specializing in showing events with a focus around location. The Today widget shows non-all-day events that are happening from now forward, and the App shows the same as well as tomorrow events.

With how this is written right now, it is mostly useful for employees of Dropbox as it parses the conference room names and pulls out relevant meeting rooms, but the default fallback works just fine.

Patches welcome to make it more versatile, or not.
